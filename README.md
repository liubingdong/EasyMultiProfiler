The EasyMultiProfiler package aims to offer a user-friendly and efficient multi-omics data analysis tool on the R platform. It facilitates various essential tasks related to microbiome, genome, and metabolite downstream analysis, providing a seamless workflow from start to finish.

### What Can EasyMultiProfiler Offer?

- **Quick Screening**: Simplify sample selection across multiple omics for efficient research.
- **Dynamic Processing**: Effortlessly switch between standardization, differential analysis, correlation, enrichment analysis, etc.
- **One-Step Analysis**: Effortlessly execute complex methods like WGCNA and GSEA in a single step.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Experience a clear, organized data analysis process that enhances productivity and clarity.
- **Caching Technology**: Leverage built-in caching to save time and computational resources during data exploration.

**Let EMP enhance your research and transform your data analysis experience!**

### Install

<u>The R version must be **4.3.3** or higher.</u>

**1. Easily install (recommend)**

```R
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")
library(EasyMultiProfiler)
```
<u>NOTE 1:</u>  For some regions with unstable networks, users could utilize the local mirrors to avoid unexpected errors before installation.

```R
## For example, China mainland users could use this
## If the mirror below failed, try another 
local({r <- getOption("repos")
r["CRAN"] <- "https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/"
options(repos=r)}
)
options(BioC_mirror="https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/bioc/")
options("download.file.method"="libcurl")
options("url.method"="libcurl")
```

<u>NOTE 2:</u>  If encountering issues related to missing compilation environments, users can resolve them by following the solution. For different R versions on the Windows platform, users need to install appropriate rtools to support the necessary compile environment (eg. for R 4.3.x need RTool4.3, for R 4.4.x need RTool4.4, [click here ~ 400MB](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/)). For Mac os  platform, users could install gfortran([click here ~ 242MB](https://github.com/R-macos/gcc-12-branch/releases)). Afterward, simply restart computer and re-try below:

```R
pak::pak("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")
```

<u>NOTE 3:</u>  EasyMultiProfiler has consistently been updating its versions while striving to maintain compatibility with the original code and syntax. Specific versions can be installed using the pak package to ensure consistency in users' data analyses.  Users could install the development version or a particular version. The version list can be found at https://github.com/liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler/commits/main/.

```R
pak::pak("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler@dev") # Install the development version
pak::pak("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler@e263207") # Install a specific version
```

**2. Manual install** 

Due to the inclusion of many popular analysis tools, the EMP package relies on dependencies distributed across GitHub, CRAN, and Bioconductor repositories. Therefore, users may encounter dependency issues during installation in different network environments. If installation errors occur, we suggest manually installing any missing dependencies based on the error prompts. Thank you for being so patient during installation. We believe EMP could greatly speed up your research work.

```R
# In the step, please type in : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioCsoft = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/bioc",
                  BioCann = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/data/annotation"))  
options(timeout = 600000000) 
install.packages("remotes") # remotes (>= 2.5.0)
remotes::install_version("patchwork",version='1.2.0',force = TRUE) # patchwork (1.2.0)
install.packages("BiocManager") # BiocManager (>= 1.30.22)
BiocManager::install("base64enc") # base64enc (>= 0.1.3)
BiocManager::install("WGCNA") # WGCNA (>= 1.72.5)
BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler") # clusterProfiler (>= 4.10.0)
remotes::install_github("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")
library(EasyMultiProfiler)
```
