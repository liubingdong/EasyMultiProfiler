EasyMultiProfiler EasyMultiProfiler package adopts an object-oriented programming method, integrates multiple data analysis modules, and realizes smooth data transfer between different modules, thus standardizing and clarifying the overall analysis process. EasyMultiProfiler not only includes the current mainstream data pre-processing methods but also has powerful analysis capabilities. It covers a variety of mainstream analysis methods (including diversity analysis, cluster analysis, correlation analysis, difference analysis, dimensionality reduction analysis, etc.), and also supports GSEA analysis, WGCNA analysis, and multi-omics analysis. Users can quickly explore data features and patterns and visually interpret analysis results in a variety of visualizations, including box plot, scatter plot, enriched dot plot, enriched network plot, bivariate plot, enriched curve plot, heatmap, sankey plot, and structural histogram. All in all, EasyMultiProfiler provides users with a one-stop data processing, analysis, and visualization service, greatly simplifying intermediate processes, and is logically clear and very beginner-friendly. 1.1 EasyMultiProfiler Installation 1.1.1 First installation (1) Mac os users: install using pak package. if (!requireNamespace(\"pak\", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(\"pak\") pak::pak(\"liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler\") library(EasyMultiProfiler) (2) Windows users: step1： install RTool According to the installed R version, install the corresponding version of RTool (e.g. R 4.3.x requires RTool 4.3, R 4.4.x requires RTool 4.4). RTool download address 1: official original address; download address 2: Chinese mirror address. RTool installation steps: On the download page, click[Download R for Windows] →[Rtools]) step2: After successfully installing the corresponding version of RTool, please restart R. Step3: Install EasyMultiProfiler package using pak package. if (!requireNamespace(\"pak\", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(\"pak\") pak::pak(\"liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler\") library(EasyMultiProfiler) Note： Common installation failure error causes: click here. 1.1.2 Update version EasyMultiProfiler is constantly updating more analysis and visualization modules, and when an update is needed, it can be updated by running pak package again. pak::pak(\"liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler\") library(EasyMultiProfiler) 1.2 EasyMultiProfiler Basics 1.2.1 Data Object Container for EasyMultiProfiler MAE object: namely MultiAssayExperiment . MAEobject is an object that users need to create initially. It is usually composed of assay and corresponding coldata and rowdata of multiple omics projects (see Section 1.2.2 for relevant definitions).MAE object of single omics project can also be created. EMPT object: namelyEMP-transporter. EMPTobject is extracted from MAEobject. EMPTobject inheritsSummarizedExperiment data storage object, mainly includingassay,rowdata,coldata and parameters required for various process analysis. EMPobject: When multiple EMPT objects are analysed jointly, they can be merged into one EMP object. Note： ① In order to ensure the original data is not tampered with as much as possible, the process from MAE to EMPT during data analysis is unidirectional, meaning that an EMPT object cannot be put back into an MAE object. ②If you need to modify the EMPT object within the MAE object, simply adjust the EMPT object, and reassemble it into the MAE object. ③When conducting joint analysis, the EMPT objects can be directly combined using the + symbol to form EMP objects, thus facilitating the process of multi-omics analysis. ④When the names of the projects involved in the combination are the same, the name of the subsequent project will be automatically modified to ensure the uniqueness of the project names in the EMPT object. 1.2.2 Data Composition of EasyMultiProfiler Each project data stored in the MAE object contains the following three contents: assay、coldata 、rowdata. assay refers to the experimental data of the project; coldata refers to the sample-related data; and rowdata refers to the feature-related data. Assay Coldata Rowdata Column Feature Sample related data Feature related data Row Sample ID Sample ID Feature 1.2.3 Data Presentation of EasyMultiProfiler EasyMultiProfiler package uses tibble format (a data frame type) to present data, where under the tibble column names, users can view the corresponding column data types. Common data types include: int - integer type, dbl - floating point type, chr - string type, lgl - logical type (True and False), fct - factor type, date - date type, dttm - datetime type. 1.2.4 Data Transfer of EasyMultiProfiler EasyMultiProfiler package uses |> operator to facilitate data transfer, where the output of the previous module serves as the input for the next module (similar to the function of the %>% operator in package Magrittr ), thus enabling sequential data processing operations. Because EMPT objects are passed through the data analysis process, there is little mandatory analysis order throughout the process. Users are free to explore data analysis in individual modules without worrying about matching data delivery. 1.2.5 Action Parameters of EasyMultiProfiler When the EasyMultiProfiler package performs data analysis, project data is stored in EMPT object and passed between functional modules. After the user completes the analysis of a module, the parameter action can be used to extract the original analysis results generated by the module. The default value of this parameter is action='add', which means that the analysis result of the current module will be added to the EMPT object for transmission; action='get', which means that the analysis result of the current module will be directly output. Note： The parameter action in the module EMP_filter is used to specify whether the module operation is to kick or select. 1.2.6 Caching Mechanism of EasyMultiProfiler The main analysis modules of EasyMultiProfiler package have a cache snapshot mechanism, that is, when the same data is used for analysis repeatedly, the analysis process will automatically extract the corresponding data analysis results from the cache according to the hash value, so as to avoid double calculation. This caching feature greatly improves the convenience of the analysis process and avoids the need to create multiple intermediate variables in traditional data analysis to store complex computing results. Users only need to pass the current calculation results through the |> operator to successfully complete each analysis step, making the entire analysis process clearer and more concise. Note： ① The caching mechanism takes into account the differences between data, parameters and modules, and eliminates the possible data conflicts. ② If you need to recalculate, you can specify parameter use_cached=FALSE to cancel the cache of this module. &#x1F3F7;️Example： The first calculation takes about 7 seconds. When it was calculated again, it took only 0.004 seconds. data(MAE) ## First run system.time({ MAE |> EMP_assay_extract('geno_ec') |> EMP_WGCNA_cluster_analysis(RsquaredCut = 0.85) }) ## Second run system.time({ MAE |> EMP_assay_extract('geno_ec') |> EMP_WGCNA_cluster_analysis(RsquaredCut = 0.85) }) ## Close the cached system.time({ MAE |> EMP_assay_extract('geno_ec') |> EMP_WGCNA_cluster_analysis(RsquaredCut = 0.85,use_cached = FALSE) }) Copyright © 382983280@qq.com 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook更新时间： 2024-09-09 20:25:03 "},"MD/2 创建MAE对象.html":{"url":"MD/2 创建MAE对象.html","title":"Chapter 2 Import data","keywords":"","body":"2. Create MultiAssayExperiment Object This section illustrates how to import data from multi-omics projects into the analysis process. 2.1 Multi-omics Data When the user processes data from multi-omics projects, the data needs to be imported and combined into an MAE object. 2.1.1 Create a relationship table of sample ID and subject ID In the study, each subject has a unique subject ID (e.g., P1, P2, P3...), and each subject may collect a variety of biological samples and measure corresponding data, including species annotation (taxonomy) for 16s rRNA gene sequencing, KO annotation (geno_ko) for microbial functional genes, eczymatic annotation (geno_ec) for microbial functional genes, etc. When analyzing data from one or more projects, in most cases the subject ID and sample ID are the same (e.g., subject ID P1, project name taxonomy, sample ID P1). But sometimes we also face the following situations: Only single-omic project: the subject ID and the sample ID are inconsistent (e.g., subject ID P1, project name taxonomy, sample ID tax_1); Multi-omics projects: Within the same subject, sample ID of different projects are inconsistent (e.g., subject ID P1; project name taxonomy, sample ID tax_1; project name geno_ko, sample ID genomics_1). Therefore, in order to effectively manage and analyse this data, users need to create a relationship table (usually named DFMAP, users can also customize) to match the subject ID to the sample ID. Based on the relationship table, users are able to easily import all the data into the MultiAssayExperiment object. During subsequent analysis, the EasyMultiProfiler package automatically replaces the sample ID the subject ID according to the relationship table. The relationship table-based analysis process has the following benefits: Data Integration and Consistency: Relationship table ensure that the sample information in the datasets of different projects is properly mapped and integrated, thus ensuring data consistency. Automated processing: Data can be managed and processed automatically without manual modifications, so you don't have to worry about inconsistent naming. Streamlined analysis workflow: Consolidating data and automatically replacing sample ID with subject ID makes the analysis process smoother and clearer, reducing errors that can result from manual processing. Note：Do not confuse \"Project Name\", \"Subject ID\", and \"Sample ID\". &#x1F3F7;️Example: Create a relationship table of subject ID and sample ID. This table needs to be saved as a file and read into R. Users can also manually create data frame directly within R. dfmap Note： ①The relationship table must consist of the following three columns: assay (project name), primary (subject ID), colname (sample ID). ②The sample ID (e.g., tax_1, genomics_1, etc. in this tutorial) is generated by the upstream annotation. ③The sample ID is allowed to be same as the subject ID (e.g., subject ID P1, project name taxonomy, sample ID P1). ④The sample ID (or the subject ID corresponding to the sample ID) of each project must be a subset (or identical) of the subject ID of the sample-related data. If the sample ID in the project do not correspond to the subject ID in the sample-related data, these sample ID should be excluded from these projects. ⑤The sample ID of each omics item must correspond to the colname of the relationship table one by one. ⑥For the numbering scheme of project data before and after intervention in the same group of subjects, please refer to section 10.3. 2.1.2 Precautions for reading sample-related data Sample-related data refers to the basic information of the subject, usually including: the subject's general demographic data (gender, age, residence, etc.), anthropometric data (height, weight, waist circumference, etc.), psychological scale score results (anxiety scale, depression scale, sleep scale, etc.), test results (blood routine, liver function, inflammatory factors, etc.). Note: ① If there are missing values in the sample-related data, please leave them blank directly without using placeholders like NA, -, missing, etc. ② Please set the first column of the sample-related data as the Sample ID, and set it as the row names when reading (important). ③ Sample ID must be unique and cannot be duplicated. ④ It is recommended to set the values of categorical variables in the data as strings rather than pure numbers to avoid unnecessary issues. ⑤ For the numbering scheme of project data before and after intervention for the same group of subjects, please refer to Chapter 10.3. ## row.names=1 meta_data 2.1.3 Read microbiome data Microbiome data refers to the result files containing the abundance information of microorganisms in each sample, which are generated by various upstream microbial annotation tools. Common result files include the following five types: ASV/OTU tables, abundance tables (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species-level), generic-level abundance tables generated by MetaPhlan and Humann, Biom files, and QZV files specific to QIIME2. The module EMP_taxonomy_import supports the input of result files in all of the above formats and converts them into SummariseExperiment objects. 2.1.3.1 ASV/OTU forms The # characters on the first and second lines of this file do not need to be modified. The data file must contains species annotation information. Note: ① The data file must include a column named taxonomy. ② The taxonomy column must contain microbial annotation. ③ It is recommended to use ; character to separate microbial annotations. tax_data 2.1.3.2 Abundance table (Kingdom, Phylum, family, genus, and species-level) Since high-taxonomic data can be converted to low-taxonomic data (e.g., Species data can be converted to Phylum data), it is recommended that users directly import data at the highest taxonomy level. Note: Module EMP_taxonomy_import has a parameter assay_name which defaults to counts (absolute abundance). If the actual data is in relative abundance, you can input relative. tax_data 2.1.3.3 Classification annotation table for MetaPhlan and Humann The species annotations of this annotation table have a hierarchical structure and usually contain all the result information at each level of the genus and species of the phylum family. The module EMP_taxonomy_import can automatically identify annotation information at the highest classification level and import the complete classification data. Note: When the input data is in this format, users need to specify the parameter humann_format=TRUE within the module EMP_taxonomy_import. tax_data 2.1.3.4 Biom format files The biom format is a common species annotation result file in the QIIME1 process, and some users will also save the species annotation file of the QIIME2 process in biom format for data storage. The module EMP_taxonomy_import can directly read the biom format file and import the data information. Note: When the input data is in this format, users need to specify the parameter file_format='biom' within the module EMP_taxonomy_import. tax_data 2.1.3.5 Tabular files converted from Biom format files Biom files can be converted into tabular files using the Biom Convert method, or imported directly. 注意： When the input data is in this format, users do not need to modify the header and # character. tax_data 2.1.3.6 QZV format file In the Qiime2 process, the qiime taxa barplot generates a QZV file of microbial annotation results. The module EMP_taxonomy_import can directly read the QZV format file and import the data information. Note: When the input data is in this format, users need to specify the parameter file_format='qzv' within the module EMP_taxonomy_import. tax_data 2.1.4 Read KO/EC omics data 2.1.4.1 Ordinary tabular form KO/EC omics project data in common format refers to metagenomic or metatranscriptomic annotated result files annotated with KO or EC ID. The module EMP_function_import can directly read the annotation table and query the corresponding annotation information integrated by the KEGG database. Note: ① In the encoding, use only pure KO and EC ID, for example: instead of KO:K00010, use only K00010; instead of ec:1.1.1.1, use only 1.1.1.1. ② Within the module EMP_function_import, the parameter assay_name defaults to counts (absolute abundance). Users should input TPM, FPKM, etc., based on the actual data. ko_data 2.1.4.1 Humann format KO/EC omics project data in Humann format refers to the hierarchical KO/EC annotation tables generated by the Humann tool. The module EMP_function_import ignores the information of UNGROUPED, directly reads the comment table, and queries the KEGG database to integrate the corresponding comment information. 注意： The header of the file needs to be cleaned up and characters such as # removed. ko_data 2.1.5 Read standard table information Standard tabular data usually refers to data such as transcriptome or metabolome, which has no special format and can be imported directly. 2.1.5.1 Data import without feature annotation information This data is commonly used in transcriptome or genomic data, with \"rows\" as features and \"columns\" as samples. tran_data 2.1.5.2 Data import containing feature annotation information This data is commonly used in metabolomics data, with \"rows\" as features and \"columns\" as sampleID and feature-related annotations. When importing this kind of data, users need to specify a sampleID column. Note: ① Users can directly specify the sampleID using parametersampleID. ② Users can directly specify the sampleID using the relationship table. # specify the sampleID using parameter sampleID sample_ID 2.1.6 Integrate all data into the MultiAssayExperiment object Note: ① In this example, dfmap refers to the relationship table in section 2.1.1. ② The assay column in the relationship table must be converted to a factor. ③ Names in objlist must match the project names in the assay column of the relationship table. ④ If assembly fails, users can check the data using the module MultiAssayExperiment::prepMultiAssay(objlist, meta_data, dfmap). ⑤ For more detailed information about the MultiAssayExperiment package, refe to this tutorial. #### The assay column in the relationship table must be converted to a factor dfmap$assay 2.2 Quickly create a MultiAssayExperiment object for a single-omic project When the users only have a single-omic project data (for example, microbiome project data or transcriptomics project data), the module EMP_easy_import can be used to quickly build a MAE object and directly perform downstream analysis processes. Note: ① The parameter type includes four options: tax, ko, ec, and normal. Users should determine which to use based on the context. ② For single-omic project where no relationship table is involved, the sampleID in the abundance matrix must match those in the associated sample data. ## row.names=1 meta_data 2.3 MultiAssayExperiment object storage and reading Once the MAE object has been created, it can be stored locally for direct reading during the next analysis without having to repeat the creation step. Note： Before storing, make sure to set R's local working directory correctly, and the data files will be stored in this working directory. # Save in your working diectory saveRDS(MAE,file = 'MAE.rds') # Load the object MAE Copyright © 382983280@qq.com 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook更新时间： 2024-09-09 20:04:55 "},"MD/3 EasyMultiProfiler内置示例MAE对象.html":{"url":"MD/3 EasyMultiProfiler内置示例MAE对象.html","title":"Chapter 3 Demo data","keywords":"","body":"3. EasyMultiProfiler Demo Data The EasyMultiProfiler package includes a built-in sample MAE object that contains sample data from a clinical study with a cross-sectional study design (not from a real study) involving five omics items of stool samples. taxonomy（species annotation for 16s rRNA gene sequencing） geno_ko（KO annotation of microbial functional genes） geno_ec（EC enzyme annotation of microbial functional genes） untarget_metabol（untargeted metabolomics data） host_gene（host genetic data） 3.1 Load MAE object data(MAE) 3.2 Overview the project data EasyMultiProfiler package provides a quick data overview module, which allows users to quickly view the data stored in the MAE object from three dimensions. Data disinfection displays the number of samples and features of the experimental data in each project, as well as the data format of the experimental data in the project (including FPKM, relative, TPM, etc.; Specified by the user at the time of import). Data information shows the number of classifications of sample-related data (e.g., the number of types of basic information about the subject) and the number of classifications of character-related data (e.g., kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species of microbiome data).

Data Extract The module Data Extract consists of three sub-modules: EMP_assay_extract, EMP_coldta_extract, and EMP_rowdata_extract. These modules assist users in extracting specific project data from the MAE object for subsequent downstream analysis. To help users better understand the relationships between assay, coldata, and rowdata, this section illustrates examples of species annotation (taxonomy) from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, along with corresponding annotations for microbial functional genes such as KO annotations (geno_ko) and EC enzyme annotations (geno_ec). 4.1 Extract assay (experimental data) &#x1F3F7;️Example 1: Extract the assay of taxonomy and obtain the species annotated abundance matrix.

The EasyMultiProfilerpackage uses assay by default for process profiling. If the user needs to analyse coldata, the parameteraction='add' should be specified to convert coldata to assay, and then perform various module analysis. Note: ① In the module EMP_coldata_extract, the parameter coldata_to_assay can specify the conversion of specific coldata to assay. ② In the module EMP_coldata_extract, when the parameter coldata_to_assay is omitted, all continuous variables in coldata are converted to assay by default.

Batch effects are usually caused by the following reasons: different parts of the experiment are completed at different times, changes in experimental conditions (including instruments, reagent batches, reagent dosage, sequencing batches, etc.), different data sources (for example: integrating your own data set with public data sets for analysis), etc. The existence of batch effects may affect data analysis and result interpretation, and ordinary standardization methods are not enough to adjust the differences between batches. The module EMP_adjust_abudance can help users effectively solve the correction problem of batch effects. It contains the three most commonly used correction methods: combat_seq, combat, and limma_remove_batch_effect. These methods can improve the comparability and reliability of data by reducing batch effects. Note：Before performing batch calibration, it is necessary to integrate the project data from different batches into a single data file. 5.2.1 Combat method This module references the comBat algorithm of the sva package to correct batch effects. comBat uses parametric or nonparametric empirical Bayesian models to correct batch effects. The input data is the cleaned and standardized expression data, and the returned data is an expression matrix that has been corrected for batch effects. &#x1F3F7;️Example： Use module EMP_assay_extract to extract the assay of geno_ko .

The goal is to provide reasonable estimates of where missing values are located so that these data can be better utilized in subsequent data analysis or modeling. The module EMP_impute performs data interpolation based on the Chained Random Forests (CRF) algorithm. This algorithm is more scientific than the traditional mean or mode interpolation method. It can be used not only to impute continuous variables but also to impute categorical variables. ModuleEMP_impute supports data interpolation for assay, rowdata, and coldata. 5.5.1 Impute coldata （Sample-Related Data） Coldata of the project refers to sample-related data, which often have different degrees of missing values. Common causes of missing values include errors or omissions in the data collection process, withdrawal of subjects from the study, technical problems (e.g., equipment failure or data transmission errors), etc. The module EMP_impute can impute missing values of coldata based on the CRF algorithm. &#x1F3F7;️Example： Before imputation： coldata has lots of missing values.

To simplify the calculation and reduce the interference of these sparse features, this module provides two methods to filter the raw data. 5.6.1 Core microbial data In the microbial species annotation results, it can be found that there are quite a lot of \"rare species\"(relatively low abundance or low frequency in the sample), which causes strong interference in identifying species with differences between groups, especially when screening key species. Machine learning algorithms (e.g. random forest, LEFse) can easily identify these \"rare species\" as \"different species\" between groups. Therefore, it is necessary to filter these \"rare species\" according to uniform criteria before formal analysis. The module EMP_identify_assay introduces two important parameters to help filter: minnum (minimum relative abundance) and min_ratio (minimum ratio). First, in microbial data, any abundance below the specified minimum relative abundance is converted to 0. Subsequently, when the number of samples above the minimum relative abundance in any group is greater than the minimum ratio of the total number of samples in that group, the species is considered a core species, and the rest are classified as rare species and filtered out. &#x1F3F7;️Example： Use the moduleEMP_assay_extract to extract the assay of taxonomy. Use the module EMP_identify_assay filter to obtain core species, the parameter estimate_group specifies Group as grouping information, the parametermin specifies minimum relative abundance as 0.01, and the parametermin_ratio specifies the minimum ratio as 0.7. Note: When the input microbial species annotation data is absolute abundance, the module EMP_identify_assay will automatically convert it to relative abundance during computation. This conversion facilitates filtering and identification of core species during the process, and subsequently outputs the corresponding absolute abundance data based on the filter condition.

To preserve as much information as possible, these zeros are sometimes replaced with a minimal non-zero value.

The KEGG database contains extensive functional information about genes and their products, as well as the roles of these genes in metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, and disease pathways. This module allows for the online reading of KEGG database information, completing the standard steps of enrichment analysis. 6.6.1 KEGG enrichment analysis based on KO/EC annotations During the analysis of metagenomic microbial data, the functional gene annotation results of KO/EC can be obtained. Module EMP_diff_analysis can be used to retrieve differential genes, and module EMP_enrich_analysis can be utilized for KEGG enrichment analysis. Note: ① The parameter KEGG_Type can specify enrichment by pathway (KEGG_Type = 'KEGG') or by module (KEGG_Type = 'MKEGG'). ② The parameter species defaults to using all species data as background genes (species = 'all').

Since building predictive models often requires multiple parameter tuning optimizations, using default parameters can often lead to unsatisfactory results. Therefore, the design of module EMP_marker_analysis aims to assist users in quickly screening potential markers, rather than focusing on building and optimizing predictive models. 6.7.1 Estimate the importance of features based on the Boruta algorithm &#x1F3F7;️Example： The Boruta algorithm can be used to quickly categorize the features in the data into three categories, Confirmed , Tentative , and Rejected , based on the classification in coldata.

To facilitate the user's understanding, the following describes the basic parameters of the module EMP_filter: obj: Specify the object to be analyzed, either MAE or EMPT. experiment: Specify the name of the project to be analyzed (character). sample_condition: Specify the threshold conditions for selecting samples. feature_condition: Specify the threshold conditions for selecting features. filterSample: Specify the names of the samples to be filtered. filterFeature: Specify the names of the features to be filtered. action: Used in conjunction with parameters filterSample and filterFeature, set to kick or select. show_info: Specify the display method of the output results. Note: ① It is necessary to understand the filtering logic in the module EMP_filter. First, samples and features are filtered based on the conditions specified by the parameters sample_condition and feature_condition. Then, samples and features are selected or kicked based on the parameters filterSample and filterFeature. ② If EMP_filter operation does not meet the filtering requirements in once time, the EMP_filter process can be performed multiple times. 7.1.1 Filter the data across all the experiments in MAE &#x1F3F7;️Example 1：Screen male subjects older than 30 years from all omics projects. MAE |> EMP_filter(sample_condition = Sex == 'M' & Age >30) After filtering, only the samples that meet the conditions that exist in the MAE object, and other analysis modules can be directly used for downstream analysis. For example, users can use the module EMP_coldata_extract to observe the filtered sample. MAE |> EMP_filter(sample_condition = Sex == 'M' & Age >30) |> EMP_coldata_extract() &#x1F3F7;️Example 2：Select the samples without missing values in the sample-related data. Note： The module EMP_filter inherits the filter syntax from the dplyr package, so the tidy syntax for filtering is avaviable.

Extract the assay of geno_ec. Perform WGCNA analysis followed by DESeq2 difference analysis, and then filter the data based on the following criteria: Samples older than 30 years; Core genes identified by edgeR; Genes from the WGCNA analysis that are associated significantly with BMI; Genes with a p-value less than 0.05 in the difference analysis.

However, once the screening is complete, the previously stored results may no longer be right and are therefore automatically cleared away (e.g., the results of the difference analysis and alpha diversity analysis are stored in the container, and then some samples are excluded based on the BMI value). At this stage, the existing difference analysis results are automatically cleared because they are no longer right; The alpha diversity results are not affected by the sample change and will continue to be stored in the object for the next screening). The EasyMultiProfiler package already automates this process and will alert the user in red text that the action has been performed. 7.1.4 Regarding the display of filtered data In the analysis workflow of the EasyMultiProfiler package, after filtering with the module EMP_filter, the output will by default retain the display results from the previous analysis module. For example, if the previous module performed alpha diversity calculations, and EMP_filter is used to filter based on the Age>30 condition, the EMP_filter output will continue to display the filtered results from the previous module.

To ensure that paired tests work properly, subject numbers need to be specially numbered when importing data. &#x1F3F7;️Example： Step1: Process sample-related data. To comply with the ordering requirements of the paired test, characters A and B were added to the subject number in the primary column to distinguish between pre-and post-intervention, respectively. Step2: Process the relationship table. If users need to import multi-omics data, the relationship table is also processed in the same way as step 1. **Step3: **Paired difference analysis. Perform a paired difference test with the parameter `paired=TRUE` Note： ①The following codes are for display only, and there is no paired data in the example data. ②The modules EMP_boxplot and EMP_scatterplot are designed to quickly visualize the results of difference tests, but cannot complete paired tests or ANOVA calculations. The user can manually modify the plot based on the result from module EMP_diff_analysis.

However, due to the limitation of database annotations, some taxa may have lower-level annotations with the same name but upper-level annotations with different names. This situation will cause the `EMP_collapse` function to merge different bacteria in genus-level data collapse incorrectly. As follows: Family Genus Species Lachnospiraceae Ruminococcus unclassified Ruminococcaceae Ruminococcus unclassified Oscillospiraceae Ruminococcus unclassified Therefore, EasyMultiProfiler provides two microbial annotation methods: complete-level annotation and single-level annotation. Users can choose the appropriate method according to their needs. 1. Full-level annotation is more rigorous in annotation and is suitable for analyses that do not involve specific bacterial names (such as alpha diversity, and beta diversity analysis). In this case, using the complete level annotation is recommended. If a drawing involving specific bacterial names is involved, it is recommended to use `ggsave` to save the graph first, and then manually adjust the labels and annotations to improve the readability of the graph. 2. Single-level annotation can meet the needs in most cases and will not affect the visualization effect. &#x1F3F7;️Example1： The original feature is a single-level annotation： MAE |> EMP_assay_extract('taxonomy') |> EMP_collapse(estimate_group = 'Phylum',collapse_by = 'row') Convert to complete-level annotation： Note： This function can only work before collpsing microbial data based on taxonomy profile.
