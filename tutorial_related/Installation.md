EasyMultiProfiler depends on several R packages, so issues such as environment dependency conflicts may arise during installation. This section covers common installation errors and their solutions.

### **Easily install**

```R
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_version("patchwork",version='1.2.0',force = TRUE)
pak::pak("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")
library(EasyMultiProfiler)
```
#### 1. Common error about the timeout
Solution method:
>For some regions with unstable network, users could utilize the local mirrors to avoid unexpected errors before installation.
```R
## For china main land users could use this
local({r <- getOption("repos")
r["CRAN"] <- "https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/"
options(repos=r)}
)
options(BioC_mirror="https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/bioc/")
options("download.file.method"="libcurl")
options("url.method"="libcurl")
```

#### 2. Common error about the "pkgbuild::check build tools(debug = TRUE)"

Solution method:

>Windows users may encounter an error <u>"Could not find tools necessary to compile a package"<u> during the installation process. To address this, it's essential to install Rtools beforehand (eg. for R 4.3.x need RTool4.3, for R 4.4.x need RTool4.4, [click here ~ 400MB](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN/)). Afterward, simply restart R and re-try ```pak::pkg_install("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")```.

#### 3. Common error about "Cannot open lock file: Permission denied"

>For this situation, users could delete the un-downloaded files in the R

```R
## For mac
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library/_cache/*
```

###  **Manual install** 

```R
# In the step, please type in : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioCsoft = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/bioc",
                  BioCann = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/data/annotation"))  
options(timeout = 600000000) 
install.packages("remotes") # remotes (>= 2.5.0)
remotes::install_version("patchwork",version='1.2.0',force = TRUE) # patchwork (1.2.0)
install.packages("BiocManager") # BiocManager (>= 1.30.22)
BiocManager::install("base64enc") # base64enc (>= 0.1.3)
BiocManager::install("WGCNA") # WGCNA (>= 1.72.5)
BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler") # clusterProfiler (>= 4.10.0)
remotes::install_github("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler")
library(EasyMultiProfiler)
```
#### 1. Common error about the timeout.

Solution method:
>Because EasyMultiProfiler includes many necessary data to provide comprehensive tools, the package size (~10MB) may lead to install timeout errors for some users in bad network regions. Users could reset the Max link time to make sure the installation is successful.
```R
options(timeout = 600000000) 
```

#### 2. Common error about the can't find the Bioconductor repository by install_github

Solution method:

>Users could set the correct repository handly to make the installation.

```R
setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioCsoft = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/bioc",
                  BioCann = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/data/annotation"))  
```

#### 3. Common errors about patchwork

Because the patchwork has two versions to lead to unexpected conflict in the package enrichplot, users need to degrade the patchwork from 2.4 to 1.2.0.

<img src="Installation_figs/patchwork_error1.jpg" alt="patchwork_error2" style="zoom:100%;" />

Solution method 1:

>During the installation process, be careful not to upgrade the patchwork to version 2.4.

<img src="Installation_figs/patchwork_error2.jpg" height="360" width="820" />

Solution method 2:

>If conflict already occurred, users could check the patchwork version and re-install patchwork at the version 1.2.0.

```R
remotes::install_version("patchwork",version='1.2.0',force = TRUE)
pak::pkg_install("liubingdong/EasyMultiProfiler") ## After restart R
```
